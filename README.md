# pyNetatmoHue

This repository contains the module 'pyNetatmoHue.py' (Python code) that allows you to continuously automatically adjust the colours of your Hue lights according to the measured PPM levels by your Netatmo weather station. 

This is usefull when you want to easily monitor the PPM level in your room so you known when you need to ventilate your room (additionally). 

You can speficy a Netatmo Station and Module to measure the PPM level, a Hue light that will colour as the PPM level changes and a motion sensor (optional) that check if anybody is present in the room, if not, that light will not change colour.
